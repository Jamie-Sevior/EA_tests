Hi, the code test came with three seperate sections and so I've added the three solutions within this folder. 

The first part is labeled EA_TEST_1, and depending on how the question is read it either errors as theres a semi colon after 
the for loop parameters, or produces an array containing 10 int value of 1-10.

The second part is within the html file as requested.

The third part is labeled EA_TEST_3 and has some example lists and functions of different kinds.
